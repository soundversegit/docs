<Accordion title="What is Royalty Free?">
Royalty-free music allows you to incorporate it into your content without recurring royalty payments to the artists or rights holders each time it's played. However, this doesn't necessarily cover public performance rights, so there may still be royalty fees when you release it on digital platforms.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Where can I use Soundverse’s Royalty Free Music?">
You can use the audio generated by Soundverse on platforms such as:
* YouTube, Vimeo Videos (Not YouTube Music)

<Accordion title="What is Custom License?">
Custom License gives you rights to make money, redistribute the compositions created at Soundverse.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How does Custom Licensing work?">
We calculate the length of unique AI generated/ processed content either in clip you export or content of arrangement view.
For e.g. Text-to-Music comes under AI generated content. Voice to Instrument is AI processed content. Voice Recording does not come under AI generated content.
If a 60 second clip is looped 4 times when exporting (essentially making it 4 minutes), users only pay for 60 seconds.
If a song has one minute of unique AI generated/ processed content and three minutes of user recorded/ uploaded content (such as their earlier recordings etc.); you only pay for AI generated/ processed content i.e. one minute. You do not pay for the total duration of four minutes.
Every minute of content costs 5 USD for Creator Plan and 3 USD for Pro Plan. For an export, you pay a minimum of 5 USD or 3 USD depending on the plan. If AI generated content is 15 seconds, user still pays for a minimum of 5 USD for Creator Plan or 3 USD for Pro Plan. 
We’re setting a minimum transaction cost as most of the money from a small transaction goes to the payment provider and in currency exchange. To keep this business model viable, we keep it simple.
If you use 15 second audio, and append recorded content increasing the duration of composition, let’s say for 5 minutes, you still pay for 15 seconds.
For any additional content beyond 60 second, calculation will be done on pro-rata basis. For e..g. For 90 seconds, Creator user pays 60 seconds (5 USD) + 30 seconds (2.5 USD) i.e. 7.5 USD. Pro user pays 60 seconds (3 USD) + 30 seconds (1.5 USD) i.e. 4.5 USD.
