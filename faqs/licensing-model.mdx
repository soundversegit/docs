<Accordion title="Can I simply upload Soundverse generated content on Spotify and monetise it?">
No. There should always be some human added content alongwith the generated music. Your final composition can't have 100% of Soundverse generated content.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is Royalty Free?">
Royalty-free music allows you to incorporate it into your content without recurring royalty payments to the artists or rights holders each time it's played. However, this doesn't necessarily cover public performance rights, so there may still be royalty fees when you release it on digital platforms.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I want to Upload music to YouTube, which Subscription Tier supports it?">
All the subscription tiers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I make a meditation podcast where music is borderline the main product alongwith some human voices. Which Subscription Tier is for me?">
All the subscription tiers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I want to use Soundverse's generated music in my composition as a sample, can I do it?">
In Pro subscription tier, Yes. 
In Creator tier, you might want to buy the Custom License to clear the Sample Usage. 
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is Custom License?">
Custom License gives you more control if you want to monetize the clip, project content or collections, and redistribute them. Unlike Royalty Free usage, here music can be the final active output and not passive (For e.g. added to YouTube or any other video).
There are two categories of licenses in Soundverse:
* Sample Usage License.
* Full Ownership License.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is Sample Usage - Custom License?">
* Samples User License- Under this agreement, the users can distribute samples generated by Soundverse as part of a creation. Users with Pro Subscription (Tier 2) have this license by default.
- This will cover usage of License in your own creations as long as Sample doesn't become the final product.
- You can use this sample in your own creations. You're allowed to distribute it to Spotify/ Apple Music, as long as this sample usage doesn't make 100% of your final track.
- By distribution here, we mean you can distribute sample that's part of your creation. Sample alone can't be resold or you can't make Sample Packs and Sell them in a different stores. Those activities are not permitted.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What is Full Ownership - Custom License?">
* Full Ownership License- Under this license,  users will own the audio that is generated. Users can reproduce, perform and re-distribute the sample. The charges for this depends on the subscription tier. We've broken down the charges in the next question.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can you help me understand when do I need a Custom License?">
It depends on the subscription tier.

For Free Users:
- You can't buy a license until you're subscribed. 
- Free users can use the content for non-commercial usage.

For Pro Subscriber:
- Pro subscription tier users have Royalty Free + Sample Usage License to use Soundverse generated sample as part of their content. No extra license is needed.
- Pro subscription tier users can buy full ownership of the generated content through Full Ownership Custom License through "Buy Custom License".

For Creator Subscriber:
- Every audio generated is Royalty Free. 
- Users can buy Sample Usage License + Full Ownership License through "Buy Custom License"

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How is the Custom License cost calculated?">

For Sample Usage License in Creator Tier:
- We calculate the length of unique AI-generated/ processed content either in the clip you export or the content of the arrangement studio. 
- E.g. Text-to-Music comes under AI-generated content. Voice Recording does not come under AI-generated content. 
- If a 60-second clip is looped 4 times when exporting (essentially making it 4 minutes), users only pay for 60 seconds. If a song has one minute of unique AI generated/ processed content and three minutes of user recorded/ uploaded content (such as their earlier recordings etc.); you only pay for AI generated/ processed content i.e. one minute. 
- You do not pay for the total duration of four minutes. Every minute of content costs 4 USD for the Creator Plan. 
- If AI-generated content is 15 seconds, the user still pays a minimum of 4 USD for the Creator Plan. We’re setting a minimum transaction cost as most of the money from a small transaction goes to the payment provider. 
- To keep this business model viable, we keep it simple. If you use 60-second audio, and layer recorded content increasing the duration of composition, let’s say for 5 minutes, you still pay for 60 seconds. 
- For any additional content beyond 60 seconds, calculation will be done on a pro-rata basis. For e..g. For 90 seconds, the Creator user pays 60 seconds (4 USD) + 30 seconds (2 USD) i.e. 6 USD.

For Full Ownership License in Creator Tier:
- For 60 seconds it costs 6 USD
- For 1 minute 30 seconds it costs 6 USD + 3 USD i.e. 9 USD.
- For 2 minutes it costs 12 USD. 

For Sample Usage License in Pro Tier:
- No charges as this license  is already included in this tier.

For Full Ownership License in Pro Tier:
- For 60 seconds it costs 5 USD
- For 1 minute 30 seconds it costs 56 USD + 2.5 USD i.e. 7.5 USD. (In Creator Tier, is costs 9 USD.)
- For 2 minutes it costs 10 USD.

In conclusion, you save more money in Creator Tier Sample Usage is already included and Full Ownership costs are lesser.
