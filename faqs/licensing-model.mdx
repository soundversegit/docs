<Accordion title="What is Royalty Free?">
Royalty-free music allows you to incorporate it into your content without recurring royalty payments to the artists or rights holders each time it's played. However, this doesn't necessarily cover public performance rights, so there may still be royalty fees when you release it on digital platforms.

<Accordion title="What is Custom License?">
Custom License gives you the right to monetize the clip, project content or collections, and redistribute them.
There are two categories of licenses in Soundverse:
* Samples User License Agreement- Under this agreement, the users can distribute samples generated by Soundverse as part of a creation. Users with Pro Subscription (Tier 2) have this license by default.
* Full Ownership License Agreement- Under this agreement,  users will own the audio that is generated. Users can reproduce, perform and re-distribute the sample. The charges for this depends on the subscription tier. We've broken down the charges in the next question.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can you help me understand if I need a Custom License">
It depends on the subscription tier.

For Free Users:
- You can't buy a license until you're subscribed. 
- Free users can use the content for non-commercial usage.

For Pro Subscriber:
- Pro subscription tier users have Royalty Free + Sample Usage License to use Soundverse generated sample as part of their content. No extra license is needed.
- Pro subscription tier users can buy full ownership of the generated content through Full Ownership Custom License through "Buy Custom License".

For Creator Subscriber:
- Every audio generated is Royalty Free. 
- Users can buy Sample Usage License + Full Ownership License through "Buy Custom License"

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How is the Custom License cost calculated?">

For Sample Usage in Creator Tier:
- Users pay only for the duration of unique AI-generated content used, not for the total duration of the composition, with a minimum charge per transaction.
- We calculate the length of unique AI-generated/ processed content either in the clip you export or the content of the arrangement studio. 
- E.g. Text-to-Music comes under AI-generated content. Voice Recording does not come under AI-generated content. 
- If a 60-second clip is looped 4 times when exporting (essentially making it 4 minutes), users only pay for 60 seconds. If a song has one minute of unique AI generated/ processed content and three minutes of user recorded/ uploaded content (such as their earlier recordings etc.); you only pay for AI generated/ processed content i.e. one minute. 
- You do not pay for the total duration of four minutes. Every minute of content costs 5 USD for the Creator Tier. For export, you pay a minimum of 1 minute of content i.e. 5 USD. 
- If AI-generated content is 15 seconds, the user still pays a minimum of 5 USD for the Creator Plan. We’re setting a minimum transaction cost as most of the money from a small transaction goes to the payment provider. 
- To keep this business model viable, we keep it simple. If you use 60-second audio, and append recorded content increasing the duration of composition, let’s say for 5 minutes, you still pay for 60 seconds. 
- For any additional content beyond 60 seconds, calculation will be done on a pro-rata basis. For e..g. For 90 seconds, the Creator user pays 60 seconds (5 USD) + 30 seconds (2.5 USD) i.e. 7.5 USD.

For Full Ownership in Creator Tier:
- For Full Ownership License Agreement, where the user will owns the audio generated and will have the right to reproduce, perform and distribute the sample will costs 1.5 times the amount of Sample Usage License. Charges totally depend on the tier and length of the AI generate audio.
- For e.g. 1 minute of AI generated content will cost 4 USD x 1.5 i.e. 6 USD.
- For 90 seconds it's 60 seconds + 30 seconds = 6 + 3 = 9 USD
- 2 minute of AI generated content will cost 8 USD x 1.5 i.e. 12 USD.

For Sample Usage in Pro Tier:
- No charges as this is already included in this tier.

For Full Ownership in Pro Tier:
- Users pay only for the duration of unique AI-generated content used, not for the total duration of the composition, with a minimum charge per transaction. 
- Every minute of full ownership for Pro Tier costs 5 USD (For Creator it costs 6 USD)
- For any additional content beyond 60 seconds, calculation will be done on a pro-rata basis. For e..g. For 90 seconds, the Pro user pays 60 seconds (5 USD) + 30 seconds (2.5 USD) = 7.5 USD. In Creator Tier, same duration would cost 9 USD.
