## Craft a prompt
Craft a perfect prompt to be given as the input to the Soundverse assistant. In order to get the desired audio, provide an elaborative prompt to the assistant. Here are some tips to draft the perfect prompt-

* Specify the genre- Rock, electronic, house, pop, jazz etc. 
* Mention the instruments to be included- Guitar, Bass, Synth, Piano, Drums etc.
* Narrate the vibe of the audio to Soundverse
* After receiving initial outputs, feel free to iterate and refine your prompt based on the results. 
* Don't be afraid to let the AI surprise you. Sometimes, giving it some creative freedom can yield fantastic results.

Example: Craft a modern hard rock song with a ‘powerful’ and ‘high-energy’ vibe. Feature roaring electric guitars, pounding drums, and a fast tempo. This track should be perfect for pumping up the adrenaline.

* Generate an electronic dance music (EDM) composition with a ‘hypnotic’ and ‘uplifting’ feel. Employ synthesizers, a pounding bassline, and a brisk tempo. Create a track that’s sure to get the party started on the dancefloor.
* Produce a grunge-inspired rock anthem that's raw and rebellious. Incorporate distorted guitars and powerful drums. Create a song that captures the spirit of alternative rock from the '90s.
