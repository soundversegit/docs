With this functionality, you can take the music you've created in the studio and explore even greater depths of composition and arrangement. Arrangement view allows users to control specifics of the arrangement such as intro, verse, drop, chorus, outro, bridge etc. This allows users to have more finer control of the generated composition. Users can drag drop/ add the snippets into this tab. They can additionally easily move, extend, delete sections such as chorus or outro.

# Quick Guide to Arrangement view!

## Craft a prompt

Craft a perfect prompt to be given as the input to the Soundverse assistant. In order to get the desired audio, provide an elaborative prompt to the assistant. Here are some tips to draft the perfect prompt-

* Specify the genre- Rock, electronic, house, pop, jazz etc. 
* Mention the instruments to be included- Guitar, Bass, Synth, Piano, Drums etc.
* Narrate the vibe of the audio to Soundverse
* After receiving initial outputs, feel free to iterate and refine your prompt based on the results. 
* Don't be afraid to let the AI surprise you. Sometimes, giving it some creative freedom can yield fantastic results.

Example: 

* Craft a modern hard rock song with a ‘powerful’ and ‘high-energy’ vibe. Feature roaring electric guitars, pounding drums, and a fast tempo. This track should be perfect for pumping up the adrenaline.

* Generate an electronic dance music (EDM) composition with a ‘hypnotic’ and ‘uplifting’ feel. Employ synthesizers, a pounding bassline, and a brisk tempo. Create a track that’s sure to get the party started on the dancefloor.
* Produce a grunge-inspired rock anthem that's raw and rebellious. Incorporate distorted guitars and powerful drums. Create a song that captures the spirit of alternative rock from the '90s.

## Generate Audio

Type in the perfect prompt and then click on the arrow to generate the audio. You can click on the three dots present at the left of the arrow to select the duration, loop etc. 
(Directly turn on loop)
Create multiple audios using the same process.
Note: We recommend to turn ON the loop because if the loop is off, there is no point of adding it to the arrangement. Because technically everything that is going here is repeatable. 
(Turning loop on necessity)
