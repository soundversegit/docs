# What is an Arrangement Studio?
With this functionality, you can take the music you’ve created in the studio and explore even greater depths of composition and arrangement. arrangement studio allows users to control specifics of the arrangement such as intro, verse, drop, chorus, outro, bridge etc. This allows users to have more finer control of the generated composition. Users can drag and drop/ add the snippets into this tab. They can additionally easily move, extend, and delete sections such as chorus or outro. <b>“Turning on a loop is mandatory before moving the audio to Arrangement Studio.”</b>

## Craft a prompt

Craft a perfect prompt to be given as the input to the Soundverse assistant. In order to get the desired audio, provide an elaborative prompt to the assistant. 

Example: 

* Craft a modern hard rock song with a ‘powerful’ and ‘high-energy’ vibe. Feature roaring electric guitars, pounding drums, and a fast tempo. This track should be perfect for pumping up the adrenaline.

* Generate an electronic dance music (EDM) composition with a ‘hypnotic’ and ‘uplifting’ feel. Employ synthesizers, a pounding bassline, and a brisk tempo. Create a track that’s sure to get the party started on the dancefloor.

## Generate Audio

Type in the perfect prompt and then click on the arrow to generate the audio. You can click on the three dots present at the left of the arrow to select the duration, loop etc. 
(Directly turn on loop)
Create multiple audios using the same process.
Note: We recommend turning ON the loop because if the loop is off, there is no point in adding it to the arrangement. Because technically everything that is going on here is repeatable. 
(Turning loop on necessity)
