## Tokens 
You can always keep a check on the balance of your tokens, the number of tokens are mentioned in the  left bottom side of the studio. Also, the remaining token balance in the end of every month gets rolled over for the next moth which ensures zero wastage of tokens! You can check the balance of your tokens in manage your account section in my plan.
