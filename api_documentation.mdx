## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

## Generation Endpoints

For all generation endpoints, you must provide either audioUrl, or prompt.

## Statuses:

- You can view the current status of your generation request using the **GET /status/generations/{message_id}** endpoint described below for checking the status of message_id.
- You can view the generation data once it is successful, using the **GET /generations/{userId}/{messageId}**
