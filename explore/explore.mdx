Weâ€™re thrilled to unveil the new Explore section in Soundverse! Discover and listen to prompts crafted by fellow users, and show your support by liking your favourites. This feature allows you to uncover fresh ideas and promote the work of talented creators. Simply navigate to the Explore tab on the right. Upon finding a prompt that piques your interest, click to listen and express your appreciation by liking it. Additionally, the Featured tab under the Explore section showcases top picks picked up by the algorithm.

Simply navigate to https://www.soundverse.ai/explore to try Explore.

If you want to keep your prompts private, simply turn on "private prompts" options within 'project settings'.
